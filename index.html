        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who loves everything about the web. I've lived in two states, New Mexico and Arizona. I attended New Mexico Highlands University and majored in Biology. 
          Now, I have completely shifted my career path to web development. I am extremly fascinated about web development because I love the art of building websites from scratch.</p>
        <p>I’ve been working in the banking and in the asset recovery industry for the past 7 years and counting. I am extremly excited to learn the Front End Web Development skill to add to my resume.</p>

        <h2>Objectives/Targets:</h2>
        <p>Growing up, one of my favorite hobbies was doing puzzles. The fact that I was able to take one single piece and connect it to
          the puzzle gave me great satisfaction because I was able to see the picture more clear. Now, you may ask yourself, "what does that 
          have to do with coding?" Well, putting code together has giving me the same satisfaction of seeing websites come together just as 
          when I was putting puzzles together when I was growing up. My main objective is to build a solid foundation and core to fully bring my
          goals/ideas to live by coding them. Of course, I definitely want to bring my coding talent/s to the tech industry in order 
          for me to land my dream career as a front end web developer.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am working on several programming languages:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
